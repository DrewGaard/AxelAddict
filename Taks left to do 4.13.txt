Things left to do:

1. Finishing the personality keyword matching
2. Personality Results Window
	- Displaying the cars to the window
3. How to use keyowrds and user input to form the string to search google API
	*First, going to finish up the basic framework of the rest of the personality side:
		~Get keywords
		~Form a temporary string to search google API
		~Parse the json 
		~Print something to the finalized personalityResultsWindow
	*Then go back and all focus on formulating a better string to search google API since that's the only thing that will be left
